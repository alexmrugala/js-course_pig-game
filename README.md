Pig Game Application

This is an application that is a two player game. Two players roll their own dice one at a time. The first player starts their roll, and can roll as many times as they wish. If the dice roll is any number except one, that value is saved to their rolling total. The rolling total keeps growing after each subsequent roll until the player either commits their total to add to their overall score, or if they roll a one. If the player rolls a one, the player loses their current rolling total and the next player takes their turn. If the player decides to commit their rolling total, this value is added to their overall score, and the next player takes their turn. The first person to 100 overall score wins.
